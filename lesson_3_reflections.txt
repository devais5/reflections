Q1 - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A1 - When I am not using my personal pc and I'm on a public pc.

Q2 - Why might you want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A2 - Because I want to keep my flexibility and update my remote repository whenever I make a logical change.

Q3 - Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A3 - Forks is a tool that can be used only in GitHub that makes a copy of a repository on my own GitHub. I can use it when I want to give credit to the original creator of the repository.
     Clone is used to copy a repository. It's used when I want to copy a repository on my local computer.
     Branches are path used to develop a new feature away from the master branch work flow.
    
Q4 - What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A4 - Because I can make changes relative to an updated version so I won't have a lot of conflicts in merging and bugs.

Q5 - How would you collaborate witout usign Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A5 - With dropbox or google drive. Load and download files on the drive and locally. It would be harder to cooperate on the same file at the same time.

Q6 - When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A6 - When I am fixing bugs on what I am working on, or implementing something on what I have already done in that branch. In this way anyone can work on the project simultaneously without interfering.
